In this chapter, we'll examine a situation where two or more users work in the main branch without any divergence conflicts between updates. I'll present a simple workflow where users make their own changes and updates without the situation escalating into branch problems.

This is a typical situation when everyone remembers to execute a pull command before making their own modifications, keeping the main branch stable.

## Stable Main Branch

\

**Situation: Remote Main (C0)**

\

Work begins with the main branch in the remote repository, where the latest state is commit `C0`.\
The remote repository is illustrated in the following diagram:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

\

**User 1: Pull (C0)**

\

**Pull**: User 1 downloads the latest data from the remote repository (`C0`) to their local repository.

\

\

**User 1: modification and push (C1)**

\

1. **Modification**: User 1 modifies files and makes commit `C1`.
2. **Push**: Changes are updated back to the remote repository.

The situation in the remote repository after commit `C1`:

\

**User 2: Pull (C1)**

\

**Pull**: User 2 downloads commit `C1` to their local repository.

\

**User 2: modification and push (C2)**

\

1. **Modification**: User 2 modifies files and makes commit `C2`.
2. **Push**: Changes are updated back to the remote repository.

The situation in the remote repository after commit `C2`:

## Summary

In this simple example, both users worked in the main branch without conflicts. Each step follows logically from the previous one: pull → modification → commit → push.

In the next chapter, we'll examine a situation where both users modify commit `C0` simultaneously. This can lead to divergent branches and conflict resolution.
