There are several methods for resolving Git branch conflicts, and their application depends on the complexity of the situation:

\

1. Sometimes a simple command `git config pull.rebase false` and a new pull-commit-push sequence is sufficient to solve the problem.

   The `git config pull.rebase false` command is run in Terminal:
    
\

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git config pull.rebase false
```

\

\

2. In more complex situations, the user might need to copy new local modifications to the desktop and perform a **hard reset**, which returns the local directory to match the remote repository's state.

   The commands to be executed in Terminal are:
   
\

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/main
```

\

\

3. If nothing else helps, creating a new clone from the remote repository is always a sure and final solution that removes all conflicts.
